Git sync solution.

A script that goes through a list of directories which are git repositories, and
for each one:

X -- Verifies it is a git repo.
X -- Verifies there is a remote named "gitsync" set up.
X -- Adds and commits all files.
X -- Does a git pull --rebase.
X -- If rebase fails, runs git rebase --abort, and logs this.
X -- Does a git push.

Another script (or an option) to start syncing a git repo. It will have some
configuration of a "base" location (e.g. robmk.com:~/gitsync_repos), and adds
that remote, creating a bare repo there first if necessary.
